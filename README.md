# GENERATIVE_MODEL_MVA

This repository contains some work for the **Generative Models** course (MVA master).

## Assignment
The `Assignment/` folder corresponds to the course assignment. It includes the files (`DM_2425.pdf`) and my submission notebook (`Lequeux_DM.ipynb`), where I implement and answer the required questions.

## Project — MMD-GANs
The `Project_Marlone-Lequeux_Ayoub-Chenguel/` folder is a small project studying **MMD-GANs** (GAN training using a Maximum Mean Discrepancy objective).

- `Demistifying_MMD_Gans.pdf`: report summarizing the method, intuition, and experiments.
- `MMD_GANS_2d.ipynb`: minimal 2D toy setup to visualize training dynamics and compare distributions.
- `MMD_GANS_fashion_MNIST.ipynb`: application to Fashion-MNIST to evaluate sample quality and stability on a real dataset.
